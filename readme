node_mumbles is a webapp built to investigate current javascript technologies. 

node_mumbles utilises nodejs including the express modules, jQuery Mobile and mustache for client side templating.
Its basically an webapp similar to Twitter where you enter mumbles (instead of tweets) and subscribe to mumbles.
